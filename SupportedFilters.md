# Introduction #

This page makes the list of dartkable supported filters in timelapse-darktable.

Use only these filters in your darktable treatment for your timelapse.

Or implement (or ask to implement) a new one :-)

If you have a java exception error in a "read" operation, it should be because of an unsupported filter (not implemented or not the same darktable version).
